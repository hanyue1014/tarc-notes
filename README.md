An obsidian vault, please view with obsidian

The notes starts with Y2S1 becuz I was lazy in Year 1

This repo is my **personal notes studying in TARC Software Engineering Degree**, feel free to use if u want, however, I must warn that it is very customized to my own will and it might not be helpful to u

PS. Rename vault-config -> .obsidian for the plugins and layouts I use
