> Process of measuring complexity of an algorithm

## Types
- [[Time Complexity]]
	- Time the code takes to execute
- [[Space Complexity]]
	- Memory required to execute the code
> Usually there will be a trade off between time and space complexity for an algorithm

## Goal
- Allow evaluating the **relative efficiency** in a way that is **independent of software and hardware** environment
- Study a high level description of the algorithm without the need of implementing it first
- Considers for every possible inputs
