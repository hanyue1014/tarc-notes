- Program used to process every pixel drawn to the screen
- Called many times per pixel fro every object in the corresponding space, even if it is occluded (被遮住), Z-buffer will deal with that later
- A computation kernel function that computes color and other attributes of each pixel
- Ranges from
	- Always output the same color
- To
	- Apply lighting value
	- Doing bump mapping
	- Shadows
	- Specular highlights
	- Translucency
	- etc
- Can alter the depth of the pixel
- Can output more than one color if multiple render targets are active
- Alone cannot produce very complex effects as it operates only on a single pixel, without knowledge of a scene's geometry
