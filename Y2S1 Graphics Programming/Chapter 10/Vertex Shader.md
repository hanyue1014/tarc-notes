- A program used to process every vertex passed to the GPU
- Run once for each vertex given to the graphics processor
- Transform each vertex 3D position in virtual space to 2D coordinates which it appears on the screen (with depth value for Z buffer)
- Manipulates properties
	- Position
	- Color
	- Texture coordinate
- Cannot create new vertices
- Output goes to next stage in pipeline
	- Geometry shader if present
	- Rasteriser otherwise
