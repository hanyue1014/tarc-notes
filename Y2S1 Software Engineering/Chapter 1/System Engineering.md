## What is it, really?
- Interdisciplinary field of engineering
	- Focus on how *complex engineering projects* should be **designed** & **managed**
- Things like *logistics*, *coordination of different teams*, *automatic control of machinery* become more **difficult** when do **large, complex projects**
- Deals with **work-processes** & **tools** to handle such "large, complex projects"
	- Overlaps with both technical & human-centered disciplines
		- Control Engineering (Technical)
		- Project Management (Human-centered)
- Deals with **ALL** aspects of computer-based system development
- The superset of [Software Engineering](Software%20Engineering.md)
- Identifies roles of (involved with system which will be developed)
	- Hardware
	- Software
	- People
	- Database
	- Other system elements
