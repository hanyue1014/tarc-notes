> Based on prototyping & iterative development
> No specific planning involved
## Huh?
- Process of writing software itself involves the planning required for developing the project
	- As in, Planning, is not a specific phase in RAD, but is done when developing the product
## Advantages
- Flexible for change 
	- Planning done when developing, so free to change plan anytime
- Each phase in RAD prioritises the customer more, and brings the highest priority functionality to the customer
- Reduced development time
- Increased reusability of features
## Disadvantages
- Require highly skilled designers
- Most applications not compatible with RAD
	- Smaller projects, can't use
	- High technical risk, can't use
- Requires user involvement
## When to use
- Short development time (2-3 months)
- Requirements well-known
- Technical risk limited
- Budget allows use of automatic code generating tools
