> Also known as cyclic model
## Huh?
- Software developed in series of incremental releases
- Four phases
	- Planning
	- Design
	- Construct
	- Evaluation
- Basically **loop the four phases** until finish
	- (My understanding)
	- After evaluation, if got problem, goes back to plan of the same module
	- If no, proceed with next module
- More and more complete versions of the system are produced in later iterations
- It's like [Linear Sequential Model (Waterfall)](Linear%20Sequential%20Model%20(Waterfall).md) + [Prototyping Model](Prototyping%20Model.md)
- Famous for **risk assessment** at **each stage of the project**
## Advantages
- High amount of risk analysis
- Useful for large & mission-critical projects
## Disadvantages
- Can be **costly**
- Risk analysis need **high particular expertise**
- Does not work well for **smaller** projects
## When to use
- Need frequent delivery
- Project is large
- Requirements **unclear** & **complex**
- Changes may be required **at any time**
- Large & high budget projects
