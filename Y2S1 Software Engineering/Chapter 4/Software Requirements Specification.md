> A document to express system requirements
> Known as Software Requirements Document
- The official statement of what is required of the system developer
- Includes
	- [User Requirements](User%20Requirements.md) for a system
	- Detailed specification of the [System Requirements](System%20Requirements.md)
## In depth
- SRS is not a design document
- Expresses what system should do without specifying how
- Requirements in this document **in principle** should be **complete** and **consistent** and **should not conflict**
## Notation
- Structured Natural Language
	- Decision table, template to specify system input, process, output etc
- Design Description Language
	- Language similar to a programming language
- Graphical Notations
	- DFD, flowcharts etc
- Mathematical Specifications
	- Based on mathematical concepts like finite state machine or sets
## Used by
- System Customers
	- **Specifies** the requirements
	- Read them to **check** if they meet the needs
- Project Managers
	- Use the document to **plan a bid for the system** & **plan the system development process**
- System Engineers
	- Use requirements to **understand what system** is to be **developed**
- System test engineers
	- Use requirements to **develop validation tests**
- System maintenance engineers
	- Use requirements to **understand the system** and the relationships between the parts
