- Need to select the approaches to be used to decompose sub-systems into modules
- Components in modules are usually smaller than sub-systems and allows alternative decomposition models to be used

## Main strategies on decomposing a sub-system into modules
- Object-oriented decomposition
	- An object model where decompose a system into a set of communicating objects
- Function-oriented decomposition
	- A data-flow model where decompose a system into functional modules that accept input data and transform them into output data
