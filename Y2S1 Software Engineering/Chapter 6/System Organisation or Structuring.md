- System is structured into a number of principal sub-systems
	- Sub-system is an independent software unit
- Identifies communication between sub-systems
- At most abstract level, can be depicted as a block diagram where each box represents a sub-system
- More specific models may be developed to show how sub-systems share data, how they are distributed and how they interface with each other

## Widely used system organisational models
- [[Repository Model]]
- [[Client-server Model]]
- [[Layered Model]]
