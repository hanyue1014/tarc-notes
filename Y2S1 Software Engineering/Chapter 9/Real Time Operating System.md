- An analogous operating system in a general-purpose computer
- Manages processes and resource allocation
- Starts and stops appropriate process so stimuli can be handled
- Allocates memory and processor resources

## Components of Real Time Operating System
- Real time clock
	- Provides info to schedule process periodically
	- A fundamental component that helps to keep track of the time in the system
	- Important when timing and synchronisation is a critical factor
- Interrupt handler
	- Manage aperiodic request for service
- Scheduler
	- Examine processes that can be executed and choose one of them for execution
	- Determine task priority and execute them according to predefined priority level and scheduling priority
- Resource manager
	- Responsible for system resource management
	- Task allocation and deallocation
	- Policy enforcement
		- Resource limitation
		- Priority based resource allocation
- Dispatcher
	- Switch task execution from one to another
	- Preemptive multitasking
		- Allow OS to respond promptly in task changing
