## What is ADT
> Abstract Data Type
- A data type
- Consists of **data that has certain characteristics** & **set of operations to manipulate the data**
- Only **behavior** is defined *(implementation not defined)*
- Expressed as `interface` in Java
- Benefits
	- Reusable
	- Maintainable
- Eg.
	- Integer
	- Double
	- String
	- Fraction
	- Counter

### Collection ADT
- A group of objects
- ***Linear Collection***
	- Store entry in linear sequence
	 - Eg.
		 - [[List]]
		 - [[Stack]]
		 - [[Queue]]

## What is DS
> Data Structure
- Implementation of [[#What is ADT|ADT]]
- Expressed as `class` that implements the `interface` in Java

### Characteristics of new DS
- Based on [[ADT Specification]], new data structure will be created and implemented with a programming language
	- Done with encapsulation -> implementation details kept hidden from the user
