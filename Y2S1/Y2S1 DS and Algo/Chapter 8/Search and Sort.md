## Searching
- An algorithm that accepts an argument `k` and tries to find a record whose key is `k`, successful search is called retrieval
- [[Sequential Search]]
- [[Binary Search]]

### Sequential Search vs Binary Search
- Binary search works perfectly with arrays, but if chain, impractical
- Chain => linked implementation => cannot reach middle in constant time, which takes away the speedup of binary search
- If array is small, sequential search is enuf
- If array is large and sorted, binary search would be better

## Sorting
- [[Bubble Sort]]
- [[Selection Sort]]
- [[Insertion Sort]]
- [[Quick Sort]]
- [[Merge Sort]]
