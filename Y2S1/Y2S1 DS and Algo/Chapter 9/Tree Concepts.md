- Previous ADTs place data in linear order
- Some data organisation require categorising data into groups and subgroups
	- Hierarchical classification
	- Data item appear at various level within the organisation
- Tree provide hierarchical organisation in which the data items have ancestors and descendants 
- Collection of nodes connected by edges (links)
- Top level is a single node called root
	- The only node with no parents
- Nodes at one level are children of the previous level
- Node with children is parent of the nodes
- Nodes with same parent are siblings
- Node with no children is a leaf node
- A node is reached from root by a path
	- Length of path is number of edges that compose it
- Height is the number of levels in the tree
- Subtree of a node is a tree rooted at a child of that node (make one of the child the root of the subtree)
- Mostly implemented in a link structure
