# History of Computer Graphics
- 1963: Sketchpad (Ivan Sutherland)
- 1969: Vector display (Evans & Sutherland 3D Picture System)
- 1970: Raster graphics
	- Diffuse lighting, specula lighting
	- Curved surfaces
	- Texture
	- Z-buffer hidden surface (front and back layers gua)
	- Anti-aliasing (make curve more smooth)
- 1972: Games
	- Pong
	- Arcade games
- 1980: Global Illumination -> help achieve photorealism
	- Ray Tracing
	- Radiosity
- 1990: Non-photorealistic rendering
	- Volume rendering
	- Painterly rendering
