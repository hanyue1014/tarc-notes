Topic: [[Y2S1 Graphics Programming]]

- Refers to the process of changing a color based on its angle to lights and its distance from lights to create photorealistic effect
- Performed during the rendering process

## Shader
- Understood as a graphics information processor on a GPU
- Programmed using certain shader programming language
	- GLSL: OpenGL Shading Language
	- CG: C for Graphics
	- HLSL: High Level Shading Language
- Type
	- [[Vertex Shader]]
	- [[Fragment Shader (Pixel Shader)]]

## Why shader programming
- Programmable GPUs allow programmers to replace hard-coded functions with a shader
	- Allow programmer do anything they want
	- Various shading techniques become readily achievable
	- New rendering ideas can be easily experimented and implemented as long as underlying algorithms can be developed properly
