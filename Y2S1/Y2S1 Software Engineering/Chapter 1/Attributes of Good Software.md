## Availability
-  Probability that a system will work as required during the period of a mission
- PS: **It will work when I want it to work**
## Functional
- Perform functions that it is required to
- Correctness
		- All function work **correctly** for all end users **according to user specifications**
- Completeness
		- **Required** function in the system is **included**
## Efficient
- Perform functions efficiently in terms of *time* and *resources*
- Low consumptions of memory and computational power
## Economical
- Running **costs not high**
## Reliable
- Not prone to hardware or software failure
- Delivers the functionality when the user wants it
- **Deliver intended service** to the user **without failure**
## Secure
- Protected against errors, attacks and loss of valuable data
- **Can withstand any attacks** or threats from any action of any external party
## Flexible
- Can **adapt to new use**
- Can **run in different countries**
- Can be **moved to a different platform**
## General
- *General-purpose* & *portable*
- Mainly apply to utility programs
## Buildable
- Design **not too complex**
## Manageable
- **Easy to estimate** work involved
## Maintainable
- Make **possible** for maintenance programmer to **understand the designer's intention**
	- High cohesion, low coupling, complete documentation
## Usable
- Give user **satisfying experience**
- Low learning curve
## Reusable
- Elements of the system can be **reused** in other systems
## Safety
- Can control recognised hazards to achieve acceptable level of risk
- If system failure, system may cause loss of human life, human injury or damage of environment, need to control the hazards until only the acceptable level of danger will be reached
