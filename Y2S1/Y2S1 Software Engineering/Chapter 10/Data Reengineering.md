## Problems with Data before Reengineering
- Data naming
- Field length problems
- Record organisation problems
- Hard-coded literals / values
- No data dictionary
- Data may be stored in an inconsistent way
	- Inconsistent default values
	- Inconsistent validation rules
	- Inconsistent units
	- Inconsistent representation semantic
	- Inconsistent handling of negative values

## Cost Factors
- Extent of data conversion
- Tool support
- Expert staff
- Software quality

## Advantages
- Reduce risk
	- Improve legacy system's security
		- Reduce risk of security breaches
	- Increase legacy system's performance
		- More stable system, minimise risk of system downtime
- Reduce effort
	- Make system more maintainable
		- Minimise maintenance effort
	- Avoid system be developed from scratch
		- Reduce effort to develop a new system
- Reduce development cost
	- Developers easier to understand the code after reengineering process

## Disadvantages
- Tool support
	- Challenging to get a suitable reengineering tool
		- Some legacy system adopting older technologies that may not be available
		- There might be compatibility issue of the tools with the legacy system
	- Challenge of learning curve from the staff to understand and learn the tools
- Engineer Expertise
	- Hard to get an engineer experienced in older technologies
		- May command high salary -> increase overall cost of reengineering process
- Practical Limits
	- Some legacy system very complicated with messy code structures and non-updated documentation
	- During reengineering process, some additional features or functionalities may need to be incorporated
		- May lead to scope creep issues if no proper management and control from the project manager
	- May lead to problems like new bugs or losing certain functionalities that were presented in the original system
		- Require thorough testing and validation efforts
