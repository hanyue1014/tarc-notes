	- Minimises the interdependencies among the different modules or components
	- Encourage isolation of changes, high modifiability in a system
	- When there are amendments, impact towards other parts of the system will be very low as they are localised to the specific areas
	- Helps improve system testability
	- Reduce total time needed to carry out the testing
