## Software Evolution Process
- Type of software differ
- Development process differ
- People involved differ
- Formal / Informal change proposals
- System implementation -> system release -> release planning -> change analysis

## Software Maintenance
- Process of changing system after it is delivered
- Reason for changes
	- Software errors
	- Installation of new hardwares
	- Customer needs
- Types of maintenance
	- [[Corrective Maintenance]]
	- [[Adaptive Maintenance]]
	- [[Perfective Maintenance]]
 - [[Factors Affecting Maintenance Cost]]

## Legacy System Management
- Scrap the system
- Leave it unchanged
- Re-engineer
- Replace all

## Software Reengineering
- Take legacy systems -> reimplement them to make them more maintainable
- 80% of software cost is on system maintenance and evolution
- Why?
	- Business procedures and knowledge of system may not be documented elsewhere
	- Poor structure
	- Outdated documentation
	- Inconsistent documentation
- Objectives
	- Improve system structure
	- Create new system documentations
	- Make it easier to understand
	- Make cost of future maintenance lower
- Process
	- [[Source Code Translation]]
	- [[Reverse Engineering]]
	- [[Program Restructuring]]
	- [[Program Modularisation]]
	- [[Data Reengineering]]
 - Software reengineering != reverse engineering
