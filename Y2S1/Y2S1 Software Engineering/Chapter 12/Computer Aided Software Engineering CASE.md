## 3 Levels of CASE
- Production Process Support Technology
	- Specification
	- Design
	- Testing
- Process Management Technology
	- Risk Management
	- Requirement Management
	- Change Management
	- HR Management
	- etc
- Meta-CASE Technology 
	- Generator to create Production Process Support Technology and Process Management Technology

## Functional Classification of CASE
- Tools are specified according to the functions they support
	- Tools: support individual tasks
	- Workbench: support process or activities like specification, analysis, design
		- Normally includes a few tools
	- Environment: support all or at least a substantial part of a software process
		- Normally is several workbenches integrated together
- Business Process Engineering Tools
- Process Modelling and Management Tools
- Data Modelling Tools
- Project Planning / Management Tools
- Risk Analysis Tools
- Requirement Tracing Tools
- Metrics and Management Tools
- Prototyping Tools
- Editing tools
- Method Support Tools
- Language Processing Tools
- Debugging Tools
- Testing Tools
- Documentation Tools
- Web Development Tools
- Software Configuration Management Tools

## CASE Life Cycle
1. Procurement (find and get the CASE tool)
2. Tailoring (customise to own needs)
3. Introduction (introduce to staff)
4. Operation (call them use)
5. Evolution (can loop back to 4) (update on the tools)
6. Obsolescence (no use anymore)

## Issues that may exist in CASE Life Cycle
- Procurement
	- Organisation standards and methods
		- Tool support XXX convention?
	- Existing computer and future computer procurement
	- Type of application to be developed
		- Choosing one that provides facilities to develop the type of applications required by an organisation
	- Security
		- Any security features?
	- Cost
		- Expensive?
- Tailoring
	- Installation and testing
	- Process model definition
		- Where to apply
		- How to interface with other tools
	- Tool integration
		- Develop interface modules to integrate with different tools
	- Documentation
- Introduction -> Operation
	- User resistance
	- Lack of training
	- Management resistance
