## Huh?
- **Breaks down** model requirements into **multiple standalone modules, multiple builds**
- **Each module** passes through *requirement*, *design*, *implementation* & *testing* phases
## Advantages
- Generate **working software** quickly and **early** during software lifecycle
- More **flexible** -> less costly to change scope & requirements
- Easier to **test** & **debug** during a small iteration
- Customer can respond to each build
- Low initial delivery cost
- Easier to manage risk
	- Risky pieces identified & handled during iteration
## Disadvantages
- Need good **planning** & **design**
- Need **clear & complete definition** of the system before it can be broken down and built incrementally
## When to use
- Requirements of **complete** system is **clearly defined**
- Major requirements must be defined
	- Some details can evolve over time
	 - Major requirements that forms the system defined clearly -> to be split into smaller module
	 - Smaller details (changing requirements that are not major) -> introduced in later increments
- Need to get a product to the market quickly
- New technology is being used
- Resources with needed skill set are not available
- There are high risk features and goals
