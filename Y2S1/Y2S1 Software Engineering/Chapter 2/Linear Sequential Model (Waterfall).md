## Stages
1. Requirements
	- Potential *requirements*, *deadlines* and *guidelines* analysed and placed into a **formal requirements document (functional specification)**
	- Define and plan project without mentioning specific processes
2. Analysis
	- System specifications are analysed to generate **product models** and **business logic** to guide production
	- Tests for **financial** and **technical resource feasibility**
3. Design
	- **Design specification document** created to outline technical design requirements
	- Programming language, hardware, data sources, architectures, services
4. Coding & Implementation
	- **Source code developed** using models, logics, requirement specifications in previous phases
5. Testing
	- Perform **quality assurance**, **unit, system, beta tests**
	- Can cause a forced repeat of coding stage to debug
6. Operation & Development
	- Deployed to a live environment (product/application is fully functional)
7. Maintenance
	- **Corrective, adaptive, perfective** maintenance carried out **indefinitely**
	- Improve, update and enhance the product and it's functionality
	- Eg. Patch updates & new versions
## When to use
- Fixed requirements
- Enough resources (丰富的资源)
- Established timeline (确定了的时间线)
- Well-understood technology
- Unlikely to have significant changes
## Advantages
- Enable large / changing team to move towards a common goal defined in the requirements stage
- Force **structured**, **disciplined** organisation
- Simplify **understanding**, **following** and **arranging tasks**
- Enable **early system design & specification changes** to be easily done
- Clearly defines **milestones** and **deadlines**
## Disadvantages
- **Not adaptive**
	- If something not perfect, whole process often needs to **start over**
- **Delays testing** till the end of the lifecycle
- Not ideal for complex, high-risk ongoing projects
- **No working product is available** until the later stages of the lifecycle
