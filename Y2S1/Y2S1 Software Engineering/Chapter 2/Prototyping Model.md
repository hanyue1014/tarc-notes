> Requires a working prototype be built before carrying out development of the actual software
## Huh?
- Prototype: A toy implementation of the system
- An **iterative, trial-and-error process** that takes place between *developers* & *users*
	- Prototype developed, tested, refined repeatedly until final prototype is accepted, which forms the basis for developing the final product
## Advantages
- Customer get to see partial product early in the lifecycle
	- Ensures greater level of **customer satisfaction** & **comfort**
- **New requirements** easily accommodated -> there is **scope for refinement**
- Missing functionalities figured out easily
- Errors detected much earlier
	- Saves a lot of **effort** & **cost**
	- Enhances the **quality** of the software
 - Prototype can be **reused by developer** in more complicated projects in the future
 - Flexible
## Disadvantages
- May be **too much change in requirements** every time customer evaluates the prototype
- **Poor documentation** <- continuously changing requirements
- Difficult for developers to **accommodate all changes** demanded by customer
- Hard to estimate **how much iteration** is needed before the prototype is accepted by the customer
- Some customer **demand actual product** soon after seeing prototype
- Developers **rushed to build prototypes** can end up with **suboptimal solutions**
- Customer **lose** interest if not satisfied with initial prototype
## When to use
- Customers don't know **exact project requirements**
- Developers new to the domain
