- If a process involves building a software, the process can be referred as software lifecycle
- Eg
	- Requirements analysis & definition

	- Deployment
	- Maintenance

## Traditional SDLC vs Agile SDLC
- Adaptability
	- Traditional: Challenging to accept changes in a project
	- Agile: Flexible and easily adapt to customers' needs
- Project Size
	- Both: Suitable for all types of projects
- Planning
	- Traditional: Should be **completed** before the development **starts**
	- Agile: **Required** in **pre-development process** (My understanding: required, got do jiu can d, pre-development, after development start before doing anything)
 - Requirement
	- Traditional: **Clear** and **won't change** during development
	- Agile: **Not Clear** and **may change** in any stage during development
- Risks
	- Traditional: Known from **preparation stage**
	- Agile: **Unknown risks** may occur at any stage
