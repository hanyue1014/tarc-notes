> Spoken Language, like how we speak normally
## Problems with natural language
- Lack of Clarity
	- Difficult to use language in a **precise** & **unambiguous** way without making the document wordy & difficult to read
- Requirements Confusion
	- [Functional requirements](Functional%20requirements.md), [Non Functional requirements](Non%20Functional%20requirements.md), system goals, design info may not be clearly distinguished
- Requirements amalgamation (mixture)
	- Possible that several requirements are expressed as a single requirement
- Over flexible
- Requirements **not partitioned effectively**
