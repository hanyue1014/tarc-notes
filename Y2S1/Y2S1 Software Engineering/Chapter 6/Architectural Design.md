Topic: [[Y2S1 Software Engineering]]

## Why important
- Large systems can be decomposed into sub-systems that provide some related set of services
- Initial design process
	- Identifies the sub-systems
	- Establishes a framework for sub-system control and communication
- First stage in design process, comes before detailed system specification
- Advantages
	- Stakeholder communication
		- High level presentation of the system
	- System analyst
		- Check whether system can meet requirements
	- Large scale reuse
		- Reusable architecture
		- The architecture may be reusable across a range of systems since it shows us how system is organised and how components interop
	- Negotiation
		- Design plan to be used for negotiation and discussion
	- Complexity management
		- Essential tool for complexity management
