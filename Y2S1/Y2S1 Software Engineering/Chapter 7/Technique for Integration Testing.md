## Top down testing
- Start from upper modules and work downwards

## Bottom up testing
- Start from fundamental modules and work upwards

## Regression Test
- Regression happens under 2 circumstances
	- Change request from client
		- Add additional functions
		- Remove unneeded functions
	- Programmer to update code due to defects
 - Purpose
	 - Ensure code change won't affect operation of other system modules/components
- Rerun test for previous increments when a new increment is integrated
- Expensive

## Retest (not related, just here to avoid confusion with regression test)
- Carrying out testing on same test case for >= 2 times
- Carried out
	- To confirm test result
	- For data collection purpose
