## Functional / Black Box Testing
- Don't know the code of the component, relies on specification of the system or component that is being tested to derive the test cases (to figure out the inputs and outputs to test)
- System behaviours can only be determined by studying its inputs and the related outputs
- Eg.
	- Functionality testing
	- Security testing
	- Performance testing

## Structural / White Box Testing
- Analyse the code and use the knowledge about the structure of the component to derive the test cases
- Analysis of the code can be used to find many test cases to guarantee a given level of test coverage
