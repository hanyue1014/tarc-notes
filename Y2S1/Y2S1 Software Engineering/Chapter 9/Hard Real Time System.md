- Operation is incorrect if results is not produced according to the timing specification
- Meeting time constraints is very critical
- Tasks must be completed within specified timeline
- Any delay may lead to catastrophic consequences (like loss of human lives)

## Example
- Car's airbag system
	- Needs to respond precisely whenever accidents occur
	- Delays will impact passenger's safety
- Air traffic control system
	- System must process and response to aircraft position and commands in real time to ensure safe operation between aircraft and prevent any collisions
- Chemical power plant control system
	- Respond to various parameters and safety procedures in real time precisely to ensure safety operation and accident preventive
	- Delay in responding to real time will lead to catastrophic accidents as well as surrounding environments
	- Worst case: Power plant explode
