- Periodically poll a set of sensors that observe and capture information from the system's environment, analysing them and manage the operation of various processes, devices or systems
- Takes actions depending on the sensor readings by issuing command to the actuators

## Components
- Sensor and Data Acquisition
	- Measures the external conditions of the system
	- Data collected via sensor for processing and analysis process
- Data Processing and Analysis
	- Collected data is analysed
		- Check for anomalies
		- Identify behaviour's patterns and trends
		- Involve certain techniques like machine learning
	- Control algorithms
		- Determine how control system is supposed to react according to the external changes
		- Eg.
			- If temperature too high, smart home system send a signal to air conditioner to switch temperature to a lower one
- Actuators and Control Devices
	- Refers to devices that responds to the control signal
	- Normally makes adjustments to the system's behaviour
- UI
- Communication Protocols
	- Protocols used to transmit data among different components in monitoring and control system
