- Operation is degraded if results are not produced according to specified timing requirements
- Timeliness of task completion is important, but not strictly mandatory
- Occasional delays are acceptable as long as overall system performance is not severely degraded or no critical failures were to happen

## Examples
- Location based service system
	- Slight delay in providing location information is still acceptable, it will at most lead to a reroute during driving
- Collaborative document editing
	- Delays reflecting changes from any collaborators will not critically impact collaborative process
- Home automation system
	- Controlling lighting, air conditioner temperature
	- Minor delay will not significantly impact home resident's experience
