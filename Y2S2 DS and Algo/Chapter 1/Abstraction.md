## What is abstraction
- Exist in mind, but no concrete existence
	- Like you know **something will provide certain functionality**, but is **not concerned about how it does it**
- To separate a complicated system down to its most **fundamental parts**
	- Describe the parts in **simple, precise** language, **name the parts** and **explain the functions**
	- ***No detailed coding happens***
