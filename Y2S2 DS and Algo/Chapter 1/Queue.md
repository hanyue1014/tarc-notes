## What
- Objects inserted and removed according to **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle**
- The element in the queue for the longest will be the first being removed
- Entries removed **in the order** they are added

## Basic Operations
- `enqueue(e)`: add e to the queue
- `dequeue()`: remove entry at the front of queue
- `isEmpty()`: returns true if the queue is empty
- `getFront()`: retrieve but don't remove the front object in the queue
- `size()`: return number of entries in the queue
