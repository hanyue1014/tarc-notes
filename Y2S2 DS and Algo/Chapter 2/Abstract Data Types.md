## How to win in Programming
- Increase Productivity
	- Project finished on time
	- More projects can be handled
- Assure Quality
	- Reliable: bug
### HOWWWWWW
- Code reuse
	- [[Abstraction]]
		- [[ADT Specification]]
		- Can focus on abstract properties without worrying how it will be implemented
		- Steps
			- Identify **general properties** and **operations** of the list
			- Produce a specification ([[ADT Specification]])
	- [[Encapsulation]]
		- ADT Implementation
		- Can use components without knowing how it is implemented in the future
		- Steps
			- Implement the ADT in a way where the programmer can use without knowing how it is implemented
- Code Maintainability
	- [[Perfective Maintenance | Perfective]]
	- [[Corrective Maintenance | Corrective]]
	- [[Adaptive Maintenance | Adaptive]]
